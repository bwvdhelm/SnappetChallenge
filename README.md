# Implementation
In this implementation I focused on creating a full-stack application that has both a backend and frontend component, each written in Typescript. The backend server makes use of NestJS, while the frontend component makes use of Angular.

The functionalities of the application is 2-part:
1. There is an overview table that allows the teacher to see the general progress and objectives worked on today, compared to previous week.
2. There is also a section where the teacher can investigate a single student further. The teacher can select the specific student here and navigate to a certain learning objective. A graph is then created to view to overal progress statistics.

# How to set up
## Starting the backend server
1. Open a terminal window
3. Navigate to `apps/backend`
4. Run `npm i`
5. Run `nest start` 
## Starting the frontende server
1. Open a terminal window
2. Navigate to `apps/frontend`
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `ng s`
